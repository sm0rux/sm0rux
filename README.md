# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pontus Falk, living in Stockholm, Sweden. SM0RUX is my ham radio callsign. I am a GnuPG and Signal user as I prefer e2e encryption when communicating with my friend. You find my GnuPG key [here](https://gpg.ax25.org/).

**sm0rux/sm0rux** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a hotel in Stockholm
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Digital Mobile Radio
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with [my Anytone 878 code plug](https://github.com/sm0rux/at-d878uv)
